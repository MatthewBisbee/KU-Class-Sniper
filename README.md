Not every class has a waitlist inside Enroll & Pay. This script allowed me to poll classes.ku.edu (24/7) every two minutes for a specific class section. Upon a seat opening in the specified section, I would immediately recieve a mobile push notification and be able to enroll before others. Successfully sniped a seat in all 3 sections I observed over 2 weeks of running with 100% uptime.
